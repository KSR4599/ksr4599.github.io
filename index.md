### Projects 

[Secure Document Storage Platform using InterPlanetary File System](/sample_page)\
A full-stack application on top of MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) stack technology that uses IPFS to store confidential documents in
an encrypted fashion. This is an incentivized Ethereum based platform that uses eth as a token to make use of the storage benefits.

[Complete Balancing Algorithm using Rotations](/pdf/sample_presentation.pdf)\
Designed a self-optimization algorithm with three phases to reduce the number of performed rotations on Binary Trees consisting of 1000,1100
and 1200 nodes at each phase. Phase 1 transformed an arbitrary binary tree into a skewed binary tree and then to a Completely Balanced Binary Tree. Phase 2 and phase 3 are more intense where we show tighter upper bounds and obtain a close lower bound on the rotation distance between a zig-zag tree and a completely balanced tree.
